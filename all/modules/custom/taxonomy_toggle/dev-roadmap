Taxonomy toggle

 - config
   - specify paths with vocabularies in, e.g.
     /arg1/arg2/vocab1/arg3/vocab2
   - path is parsed for vocabulary names and a block is configured for appropriate paths, e.g.
     /arg1/arg2/*/arg3/*


 - block
   - block is shown with a set of links, each of which changes exactly one term in the path e.g.

     if the current path were

       /arg1/arg2/vocab1-term1/arg3/vocab2-term3

     then the links shown would be:

       title vocab1-term1 (current link)
         href /arg1/arg2/vocab1-term1/arg3/vocab2-term3
       title vocab1-term2
         href /arg1/arg2/vocab1-term2/arg3/vocab2-term3

       title vocab2-term1
         href /arg1/arg2/vocab1-term1/arg3/vocab2-term1
       title vocab2-term2
         href /arg1/arg2/vocab1-term1/arg3/vocab2-term2
       title vocab2-term3 (current link)
         href /arg1/arg2/vocab1-term1/arg3/vocab2-term3


 - extra features
   - in config, use (vocab1,vocab2) in path where terms from more than one vocab could be used.
   - in config, use () in path to indicate that terms from any taxonomy can be used
   - in block, add entity count to each link title
   - debug-mode - one block appears on every page and works out whether any part of the URL is a taxonomy term. Loads vocabularies specific to any terms found - configured paths are ignored in this mode
